# TensorFlow.js Gym Pose with Squad Counter

[DEMO](https://tensor-flow-gym-pose.davebitter.com/)

## What is it?

This application was build in a few hours during one of the [iO](https://github.com/iodigital-com) Google Days where we get to try out different technologies and hack concepts together. TensorFlow.js brings Machine Learning (ML) to the browser. This results in this demo fully running on the client of the user without the need of a server to execute the TensorFlow logic on.

## Why is it cool?

This demo uses WebGL as the “back-end” for TensorFlow. A trainend ML model on the human body and pose is then passed to retrieve the datapoints from. After that, you can both visualise and build concepts around this data.

## How can I run it?

- `yarn dev` starts a development environment with hot-module-reloading
- `yarn build` create a production-ready build
